# Perceptron_Lab2
Using the robot librarian analogy helped me understand how the perceptron learns a simple rule to classify items. Each epoch is like another practice round for librarian. Everytime it makes mistakes, it adjust its sorting rule slightly to improve future decisions. The errors plot shows the librarian gradually improving.
